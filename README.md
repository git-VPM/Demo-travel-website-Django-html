Have to connect to postgreSQL with pgadmin by adding the database with the name 'traWell' and change the user, password and port in setting.py file in the project if need be.

Create a superuser in-order to access the django admin page using python manage.py 'createsuperuser' command (in virtual env if django is in one).

Current superuser with admin privileges is:
Username: one
Password: one
pgAdmin Password: 1234
